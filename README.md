# Work Day Scheduler
A simple work day scheduler app to manage hourly timeblocks

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a simple calendar application to enter and maintain the day's work in hourly timeblocks.\
Code was written in javascript using JQuery library to access DOM elements. Day.js (https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library was used to work with all the date and times on the page. The application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS Bootstrap powered through javascript and javascript libraries.

Version control was through git and the updated repository can be found at:

## Credits

I appreciate the guidance of the instrutor and TAs of edX Bootcamp for making it fun to learn the new concepts of DOM manipulation using JQuery and dayjs to work with dates and times. W3Schools, MDN Documentation, and stack overflow have been a great help in grasping the concepts of javascript. The documentations of the libraries used were helpful.
